A non-persistent attack, also called a reflected attack, is a type of XSS attack that takes place when the web application returns a response that contains some or all of the attack vector. The vulnerable application essentially reflects (or displays) the injected script, and does not store it.

The non-persistent attack requires a vulnerability that allows user input to be returned without properly sanitizing the data. For example, it can exist in an error message, search result, or any response that contains user-provided information.

Reflected XSS attacks are usually delivered to the victims via innocent-looking avenues, such as phishing emails, obscured URLs on websites, or malicious links on text messages. 

In case the unsuspecting user clicks the crooked link, submits a corrupted form, or even just visits an unscrupulous site, the malicious script moves to the susceptible web application and gets injected into its source code. The application will then reflect the payload on the victim’s web browser, which executes the code because it came from a “trusted” origin.
